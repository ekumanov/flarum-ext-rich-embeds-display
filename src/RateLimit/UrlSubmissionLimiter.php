 * The intent isn't to throttle honest posting — it's to bound the worst case
 * a compromised or scripted account can inflict on the fetch worker. Once an
 * actor exceeds their hourly budget, further URLs from their posts are dropped
 * (no placeholder rows, no jobs enqueued) for the rest of the window. Existing
 * cards keep rendering — only NEW fetches are gated.
 *
 * Per-IP limiting for guests is intentionally out of scope for v1 — pianoclack
 * doesn't allow guest posting in practice and the per-user check covers the
 * actual attack surface.
